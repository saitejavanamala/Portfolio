## About
UH Energy is an umbrella organisation at the University of Houston that conducts research and development projects for innovation in the energy sector. Besides projects, UH Energy organises Symposiums, Conferences and conducts Competitions for students. I worked with the organisation as a Graduate Assistant during my last semester of Master's program. 

These are the following activities I took part in at UH Energy:
1. Downstream Resilience Project
2. Energy Competition - Renewable Energy Data Analysis
3. Forbes Articles Data Visualization using Tableau and Adobe Indesign
4. Organizer and Designer - Downstream Resilience, Symposiums, Conferences, Meetings.

## Activities
1. Team Leader - Downstream Resilience Project

Hardening of a refinery or a plant
Prepared plant Vs Unprepared plant
Chosen LNG as there is a rapid growth of LNG compared to other sectors
Datasets: U.S Department of Energy about the Liquefaction terminals, no of trains, suppliers, etc. 
Problem Statement: Use data points to make decisions and reduce downtime (average cost: USD 150 mil)
Workflow: Collect data of 5 phases
Solution: Use reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) analysis and identify opportunities to reduce downtime.
Scenario: For example, if the maximum LNG production of a facility is 3 MMtpy and the predicted average annual production from a RAM model is 2.7 MMtpy, then the average PA would be 90%. In other words, on average, 90% of the time the LNG plant will produce at its maximum capacity of 3 MMtpy, and 10% of the time it will not produce LNG due to scheduled and unscheduled events.
The three important questions:
So, what is the typical PA for an LNG plant? The typical LNG plant PA, including both scheduled and unscheduled events, ranges from 89.4%–95.5%, with a mean value of 92.6% ± 2.2%.

Another important question is: What is the typical average production loss due to scheduled events in an LNG plant? The production loss can be accurately evaluated if the following items are known:

* Interval for maintenance and inspections
* Duration of each total shutdown
* Amounts of time needed to stop and to ramp up production.

A third essential question is: What is the typical average production loss due to unscheduled events in an LNG plant? The production loss due to unscheduled events is a consequence of the random failure of equipment. Reliability block diagrams (RBDs) and failure modes and effect analyses (FMEAs) must be performed to accurately predict the production loss. 

Result:
* Used datasets to find out the major issues at each stage of the LNG value chain. 
* Proposed Digitization solutions using sensors, virtual reality, and dashboards for every individual issue.
* Proposed a hypothetical reduction in downtime, caused due to unscheduled events, by 4%

* Introduction
The goal of the project was to arrive at a digitization solution for handling disruptions and increasing throughput in an LNG facility during the times of adverse weather conditions. For example, "You have a facility: a refinery, a powerplant, something like that. And as weather changes, it'll become prone to lowered production/shutdowns which ultimately affects the customer satisfaction and also the profitability. Now, during these adverse weather conditions, we ask the question: How can data help us keep the performance of the plant unchanged and thereby meet production goals?

* Problems
Shutdown, Delays
Production Inefficiencies

* Analysis
