## About
UH Energy is an umbrella organisation at the University of Houston that conducts research and development projects for innovation in the energy sector. Besides projects, UH Energy organises Symposiums, Conferences and conducts Competitions for students. I worked with the organisation as a Graduate Assistant during my last semester of Master's program. 

These are the following activities I took part in at UH Energy:
1. Downstream Resilience Project
2. Energy Competition - Renewable Energy Data Analysis
3. Forbes Articles Data Visualization using Tableau and Adobe Indesign
4. Organizer and Designer - Downstream Resilience, Symposiums, Conferences, Meetings.

## Activities
1. Team Leader - Downstream Resilience Project

* Introduction
The goal of the project was to arrive at a digitization solution for handling disruptions and increasing throughput in an LNG facility during the times of adverse weather conditions. For example, "You have a facility: a refinery, a powerplant, something like that. And as weather changes, it'll become prone to lowered production/shutdowns which ultimately affects the customer satisfaction and also the profitability. Now, during these adverse weather conditions, we ask the question: How can data help us keep the performance of the plant unchanged and thereby meet production goals?

* Problems
Shutdown, Delays
Production Inefficiencies

* Analysis
Choosing of the project: A liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility on an annual basis has downtime that costs USD150mil on average. We have been working on availability tools as well as software that enables us to improve the uptime, reliability, availability and reduce that cost."


* Solutions
What we have done is make all the equipment smart by adding sensors, and created Predix, an OS platform for the industrial well. With Predix, we are able to gather all these information and sort it in a meaningful fashion where we then run algorithms that improve the efficiency, uptime, reliability of the equipment,‚Äù he said.
