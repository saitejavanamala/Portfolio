## Concepts

In Access, I understand table structures, relationships, 3 forms of database normalization, and other key database concepts.
I can build and work with the five main features ---
Tables, Queries, Forms, Reports and Macros

**1. Tables -** I can create tables, set data types, establish relationships with referential integrity, edit tables in Design view, use sort, filter, masking, data validation, look up fields, etc

**2. Queries -** I can create queries using both the wizard and design view. I can establish constraints with criteria, use wild cards, AND and OR multiple criteria, create parameters, build expressions. I can also use speciality queries such as udate, delete, append. UNION and crosstab queries, etc.

**3. Forms -** I can generate forms from tables, adjust form elements in Layout view. I can create forms in design view, add components with form controls, create a navigation form. etc. 

**4. Reports -** I am aware of all the essential concepts such as Editing in design view, layout view, group and sorting records, applying conditional formatting rules, etc. 

**5. Macros -** Finally, I can create macros, embed macros into buttons, etc. 

Moreover, I understand options such as the Trust Center, Password protection, front and back end splitting of data, etc.
