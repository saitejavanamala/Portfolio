# **Concepts & Projects**

## Concepts: A glimpse of things I know in Access

In Access, I understand table structures, relationships, 3 forms of database normalization, and other key database concepts.
I can build and work with the five main features ---
Tables, Queries, Forms, Reports and Macros

1. Tables - I can create tables, set data types, establish relationships with referential integrity, edit tables in Design view, use sort, filter, masking, data validation, look up fields, etc

2. Queries - I can create queries using both the wizard and design view. I can establish constraints with criteria, use wild cards, AND and OR multiple criteria, create parameters, build expressions. I can also use speciality queries such as udate, delete, append. UNION and crosstab queries, etc.

3. Forms - I can generate forms from tables, adjust form elements in Layout view. I can create forms in design view, add components with form controls, create a navigation form. etc. 

4. Reports - I am aware of all the essential concepts such as Editing in design view, layout view, group and sorting records, applying conditional formatting rules, etc. 

5. Macros - Finally, I can create macros, embed macros into buttons, etc. 

Moreover, I understand options such as the Trust Center, Password protection, front and back end splitting of data, etc.
