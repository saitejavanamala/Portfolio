### A glimpse of things I can do in Excel:

I have used Excel for an immense amount of time in the last six to seven years: 
In school, at work and also while taking more than 20 courses on Linkedin. I am familiar with more than 200 features in Excel. 
There are four major areas which I can categorize my expertise into:

##### 1. Data Management & Data Modeling:
I can play with various Data Management features such as Sorting, Filtering, Splitting into Multiple Columns, Removing Duplicates, Data Validation and Flash Fill. I can create and manipulate pivot tables, grouping by date, by other factors, insert slicers, and also work with pivot charts. I can use Data Analysis features such as Goal Seek, using Solver, Scenario Manager. 
I have a good understanding of Business Modeling tools such as Realtionships, Power Query.

##### 2. Advanced Formulas & Functions:
Viewing, Auditing, Referencing, Debugging Formulas
Autosum, IF, Nested IF, IFS, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, CHOOSE, SWITCH
Power functions, math functions, date and time functions, string functions.

##### 3. Formatting & Charting:
I can use Conditional Formatting rules. 

##### 4. Macros
I can create and run macros.
