## About 
Piping Technology and Products manufactures pipe supports, expansion joints, pre-insulated pipe supports, and miscellaneous fabrication and is based in Houston, Texas. We manufacture about 11 categories and 30 sub categories of products used in power plants, process plants, LNG, mining, healthcare, etc. I am working with the Company as an Industrial Engineer in the Assembly department. My work involves integration of three major areas: Data Analysis, Lean thinking and Project Management. 

## Activities
For the first three months I worked in the Shipping Department to optimize and continuously improve the downstream processes such as Galvanizing, Inventory and Shipping:


### Project Galv + Inv + Floor
__Problem Statement__: As of today, xyz Pallets full of unidentified items worth of more than xyz pounds is lying on the shipping floor, in the galv area, out in the dump, and in ex rod assembly area. This is due to not identifying, misidentifying and not keeping a track of material.  Also, searching and finding, searching and never finding and therefore re-cutting has become a job function for every floor worker, supervisor and every engineer. 

__Mission Statement__ : The aim of this project is to find numerous solutions to make the inventory and shipping floor efficient by installing racks, identifying material, hiring people, and standardizing material and information flows. These solutions will aid in transforming the company into a lean and profitable enterprise. 

I, along with my team of three identified the 8 wastes of lean, implemented 5S for better organization of Work in progress inventory, came up with metrics such as Internal customer satisfaction metric, location accuracy, etc.  I came up with a proposal for layout, standard operating procedures for workflow, then discussed with my supervisor and the VP for the feasibility of the solutions. 

__Data Analysis__: I used Excel for sorting and filtering by customer name, using pivot tables to count items and parts, to build a list of unique Items, unique figure lists, then condition statements such as IF for creating process maps. etc. I used drop down lists for data validation, then formulae such as vlookup, concatenation, transpose, string functions, etc. 

__Team Lead__ - Material Identification Task Force

Me and 7 other engineers work on Identifying material and collect data and assign job numbers and item numbers, then schedule tagging and packaging. We were successfully able to identify around 100 items and parts using something called as Parts Search on the company's ERP system, then the idea struck me about writing a SQL query to come up with a solution for identifying material:

* Decreased Average Material Identification Time metric by aprox. 60% (11 minutes to 4.5 minutes) by utilizing MS SQL Server for writing SQL queries (Joins, Subqueries, Union, Intersect) leading to 20% increase in Daily Average Production metric.

Then, in the middle of the project, I was asked to moved to a new department as a Project Engineer if you like to schedule, manage and increase the production metric of Bechtel Assembly. 


* Increased Daily Average Production by 46% (1500 lbs to 2200 lbs) through exploratory data analysis using Advanced Excel (Pivot tables, VBA Macros, Power query, Data modeling, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP) and R programming (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr).


Pivot tables - 

1. For grouping items by assembly type to reduce confusion and over thinking.
2. For purchasing so and so grade material for the project.


* Generated summary statistics and production reports using Tableau and R (tidyr, ggplot2).


* Implemented Lean Six Sigma techniques (fish-bone diagram, pareto analysis, 5S, 5 WHYS) and utilized Companion by Minitab to create graphs and forms.

* Created project presentations using Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Visio for proposals and meetings


* Documented Standard Operating Procedures for Assembly and Shipping operations using Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN).


* Utilized company's Enterprise Resource Management (ERP) system, Bill of Materials (BOM), AutoCAD drawings, for data mining and decision-making. 

* Performing Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL and R to increase Customer Satisfaction metrics by reducing causal factors responsible for order delays.
