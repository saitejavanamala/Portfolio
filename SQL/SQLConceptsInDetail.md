### Concepts I am familiar with:
1. Relational Databases
2. Schemas and Object Names
3. SQL Statement Types
4. The SELECT Statement (order of execution by engine, Aliases)
5. Data types (Knowledge of different data types, Implicit and Explicit Conversions: CAST, CONVERT, STR)
6. NULLS (IS NULL, ISNULL, NULLIF, COALESCE, Two variants of CASE Statements)
7. Removing Duplicates using DISTINCT
8. Sorting (ORDER BY, TOP with ORDER BY)
9. Paging through OFFSET and FETCH with ORDER BY clause.
10. Filtering and using Predicates ( =<>, <>, IN, LIKE, BETWEEN, AND, OR, NOT)
11. Defining JOINs (at FROM clause and WHERE clause)
12. Cartesian JOIN
13. INNER JOIN (with JOIN clause using AND for multiple filtering)
14. OUTER JOINS: LEFT, RIGHT and FULL
15. CROSS JOIN (Employee position example)
16. SELF JOIN (Employee - Manager example)
17. UNION ALL & UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT (Definitions, Guidelines, Differences, Examples, Knowing which row comes from which table)
18. Built-in Functions:
  a. Scalar Functions (Points, as expressions in queries, deterministic & non-deterministic)
  b. Logical Functions
  c. Window Functions
  d. Aggregate Functions
19. Subqueries 
  a. Scalar subquery, Multi-valued subquery
  b. Self-contained subquery, Correlated subquery
20. APPLY operator

21. Table Expressions
* Views
* Temporary Tables
* Table Variables
* Table Valued Functions
* Derived Tables
* Common Table Expressions

Grouping Sets : GROUP BY, GROUPING SETS, ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING_ID 
Pivoting Data: Pivot, Unpivot
