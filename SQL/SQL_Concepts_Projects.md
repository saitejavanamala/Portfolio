# SQL: Concepts & Projects

## Concepts
In SQL, I have been coding using many concepts:

1. To beign with, I am aware of key database concepts namely Database management system, Schemas, Relationships, the 3 forms of normalization. 

1. I can write SELECT statement and perform sorting using Order BY, filtering using WHERE clause and predicates such as AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, NOT, Wildcards etc.

2. I have used all kinds of JOINS: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, INNER JOIN, CROSS JOIN and set operators such as UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT.

4. I have written both scalar and multivalued subqueries. 

5. With respect to functions: I know Aggregate functions, Window functions, Date and Time, Mathematical, Logical functions, Conversion functions. Also, functions dealing with null values such as ISNULL, NULLIF, COALESCE. 

6. I can use GROUP BY, GROUPING SETS, PIVOT, UNPIVOT for calculating subtotals and grand totals.

7. I have worked with Common Table expressions as well.
